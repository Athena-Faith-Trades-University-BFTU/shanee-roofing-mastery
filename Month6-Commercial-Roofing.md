## Tools & Equipment

- Safety harnesses & fall arrest systems  
- Scaffolding & ladders  
- Roofing nailers (pneumatic or battery-powered)  
- Hammer  
- Utility knives & roofing scissors  
- Chalk line  
- Tape measure  
- Caulking guns  
- Roof rollers (for membrane roofing)  
- Power drills & screwdrivers  
- Brooms and blowers for surface cleaning  

---

## Materials

- Roofing membranes (TPO, EPDM, or PVC sheets)  
- Insulation boards  
- Roofing nails & screws  
- Flashing materials  
- Sealants & adhesives  
- Vapor barriers  
- Roof drains & scuppers  
- Protective roof coatings (if applicable)  

---

## Safety Guidelines

- Always wear PPE including helmets, gloves, and slip-resistant boots.  
- Use fall protection systems and secure harnesses properly.  
- Keep tools tethered to avoid dropping.  
- Ensure scaffolding and ladders are stable and inspected daily.  
- Be aware of weather conditions — avoid working on wet or icy surfaces.  
- Communicate clearly with team members on site.  

---

## Preparation

1. Inspect the roof deck for structural integrity and damage.  
2. Clear debris and clean the roof surface thoroughly.  
3. Mark and measure areas where insulation and membranes will be installed.  
4. Confirm the layout with the project manager and blueprints.  
5. Pre-cut membranes and flashing as needed for efficiency.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install Insulation Boards

- Lay insulation boards evenly across the roof deck.  
- Secure boards with approved mechanical fasteners or adhesives.  
- Ensure boards fit tightly to minimize gaps.  

### Step 2: Install Vapor Barrier (if specified)

- Roll out vapor barrier sheets over the insulation.  
- Overlap seams according to manufacturer specs (usually 2-4 inches).  
- Seal seams with appropriate tape or adhesive.  

### Step 3: Install Roofing Membrane

- Position membrane sheets carefully, aligning seams.  
- Adhere membranes using manufacturer-recommended method (ballast, adhesive, or heat welding).  
- Roll membranes with roof rollers to remove air pockets.  
- Install flashing around penetrations (vents, drains, HVAC units).  

### Step 4: Secure Roof Edges & Flashing

- Install metal drip edges along roof perimeter.  
- Flash around parapets and roof edges using compatible materials.  
- Seal flashing with approved sealants.  

---

## Inspection & Quality Control

- Check all fasteners and seams for secure attachment.  
- Verify membrane uniformity without wrinkles or bubbles.  
- Inspect flashing seals for continuity and waterproofing.  
- Confirm drainage paths are clear and functioning.  
- Document inspection with photos and notes.  

---

## Cleanup & Final Tasks

- Remove leftover materials and debris from the roof.  
- Store unused materials safely for future use or disposal.  
- Inspect tools and equipment for damage and maintain accordingly.  
- Conduct a final walkthrough with the site supervisor.  

---

## Tips & Best Practices

- Plan weather-sensitive tasks for dry days.  
- Always double-check measurements before cutting materials.  
- Use a chalk line to maintain straight edges and alignments.  
- Keep communication open among team members to address issues promptly.
